I'm a Twin Cities technical writer with a knack for creating user-centric documentation.

## The Big Five  

These are my five sacred rules of technical writing:  

1.	Know your audience.
2.	Know your subject.
3.	Be clear.
4.	Be collegial.
5.	Keep learning.  
  
**Know your audience.**  
It's important to know who will be reading your technical documentation before you begin writing it. 
You should know how they’re likely to interact with the application or product you’re describing. Consider their role, how much background knowledge they might have, along with their translation or localization needs. Because it’s impossible to know every reader of your docs, aim for accessibility always. Among other things, this might include the use of semantic tagging, inclusive language, and textual descriptions of images or videos.

**Know your subject.**  
Next, you need to know your subject. Procure as much access as you can to the product or application you’re describing, whether this involves time in the shop with service technicians, a review of marketing materials, or study of engineering prints. If you have access to the application itself, perform the steps you’ve outlined in your docs to ensure accuracy. Users will appreciate this. If you need more information than the SME has provided, be sure to get clarity if you cannot find answers after conducting your own research and consulting with other tech writers on your team.

**Be clear.**  
Specificity is key in all forms of writing, and absolutely essential in technical writing. If users can't tell which UI element you're describing or referring to, you have failed them. If you've frontloaded your instructions with information that isn't relevant or that users won't need until later, cut it or move it to the end of the piece. Concision also supports clarity and most writing standards call for it. Keep your sentences short and provide ample white space between paragraphs. Use consistency and parallel construction to help readers consume information quickly.
 
**Be collegial.**  
Most professional technical writing is collaborative in some sense. Working in an Agile environment requires not only collaboration but good relationships with your colleagues in cross-functional teams. These should be built on mutual respect and your shared goal of creating a user-friendly product. During the writing process itself, be open to constructive criticism and other perspectives. Likewise, if you learn something about a product or shared tools that could benefit other writers on your team, let them know!   

 **Keep learning.**  
Technology evolves quickly and trends in technical communication change over time. Tech writers need to keep up with both. If learning more about a particular programming language would inform your documentation, take an online course in JavaScript or Python. If you’d like a more granular understanding of Markdown and HTML, build a website using both. If you’ve never worked with open source software, learn how to contribute to a project on GitHub. Be intrepid and stay curious.
